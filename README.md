Launch Arjun for fun.

Arjun Launcher is just a simulation of launching arjun, allowing you to modify any values that you want.


## Code Related Information

Almost all the code is documented within the lib/ part, beyond that, I cannot say.

ui.py is where 99% of the work is, as ui is excruciating.


## How to package to exe

Due to limitations, this game cannot be given as an exe, and has to be built using `build.py`

`build.py` requires install python (version 3.11 or higher). It also requires python to be on the system path.
