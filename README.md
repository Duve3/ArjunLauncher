## Code Related Information

Almost all the code is documented within the lib/ part, beyond that, I cannot say.

ui.py is where 99% of the work is, as ui is excruciating.


## How to install

For Windows users, go to the "releases" tab of this page and click on the newest one.
Then install the zip, extract it and run main.exe

### If it fails...

"Virus detected" may happen, this is due to code signing issues.
If this happens, you have to build the game yourself, using the following steps:

Execute `build.py`

`build.py` requires install python (version 3.11 or higher). It also requires python to be on the system path.
